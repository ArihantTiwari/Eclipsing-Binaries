# KSP_EB
Material for the KSP 2.0 Eclipsing Binaries group.

## Getting Started

1. Follow the [installation instructions](Install_Instructions/Install.md) to get the necessary packages installed.

## Week 1 & Resources

1. Python Skill development: 
   
   The following link has tutorials to topics which will come in handy in the course of our project. https://github.com/krittikaiitb/tutorials 
   
   All the topics are interesting and you can always have a look at all of them, however tutorial numbers - **7, 9, 11, 12, 14** are specifically important for our project. Please go through these by the end of the week.

2. Theoretical treatment of Two-Body problem and Binary stars

In order to proceed smoothly with the modelling and fitting part of Eclipsing Binaries, we need to first develop the basic physical and mathematical understanding of the Two-Body problem and Binary Star systems. Here are some resources which you can use to build that understanding. Many of them share almost the same knowledge so it's completely upto you to go through all of them or just one of them.

_As this section majorly lists resources, hence it will be frequently updated. So, please look out for new links and go through them._

## Week 2

_Deadline to submit the following assignments - **17th July 2021 10:00 A.M. IST**_

1. Theoretical Assignment - 
      1. Derive the formulas to calculate minimum mass, mass function and projected semimajor axis from Radial Velocity (RV) curves of Spectroscopic Binary (SB) Stars. Submit the derivation written in LaTeX.
      2.  _Optional_, go through the resources of EBs mentioned in above section

2. Programming Assignment - 
      1. Model SB star system and plot RV curves and orbit of the system. Target systems - Alpha Centauri, Mizar, or any famous SB star system (Every group should do different system)
      2. _Optional_, create 2D simulation of the Orbit of your system using Matplotlib or any other python package

3. Proposal - Submit a proposal stating your goals for this project and what would you want to achieve by the end of 2 months. You can propose anything you want as far as it is related to the topic. For ex. literature review, animations and simulations, fitting a real dataset, various EB modelling package/fitting techniques comparison, creating your own python package relating to EBs, etc. You can also look out for work done on EBs through papers, conference articles and talks to get an idea of what is going on with respect to EBs (Some resources are listed in the Week 1 - Resources section).
