# KSP_EB
Material for the KSP 2.0 Eclipsing Binaries group.

## Getting Started

1. Follow the [installation instructions](Install_Instructions/Install.md) to get the necessary packages installed.

## Week 1

1. Python Skill development: 
   
   The following link has tutorials to topics which will come in handy in the course of our project. https://github.com/krittikaiitb/tutorials 
   
   All the topics are interesting and you can always have a look at all of them, however tutorial numbers - **7, 9, 11, 12, 14** are specifically important for our project. Please go through these by the end of the week.

2. Theoretical treatment of Two-Body problem and Binary stars

In order to proceed smoothly with the modeeling and fitting part of Eclipsing Binaries, we need to first develop the basic physical and mathematical understanding of the Two-Body problem and Binary Star systems. Here are some resources which you can use to build that understanding. Many of them share almost the same knowledge so it's completely upto you to go through all of them or just one of them.

  1. Intro to Binary Stars
        1. Binary Stars - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star 
        2. Double Star Primer - https://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/bineye5.html
